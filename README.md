# Holiday destinations

UX user experience
## Project goals
The goal of this project is to help users find the ideal snowboarding destination based on their needs. 
This project was aimed towards snowboarders who wished to find the best places to board all around the world.
## User goals
To use a website that helps them find out information about the best snow holiday for them.
Have an interactive map top allow users to pick a holiday destination.
Contact details provided to allow the user to ask any questions based on their holiday.
Interactive on both desktop and mobile devices
## Site owner goals
Gather information on where people tend to go when snowboarding.
Receive contact details through the use of contact form. 
## User requirements
* Have an interactive Google maps available to see certain holiday destinations.
* Navigate through the website by using an popout nav bar to save from clutter on the desktop and mobile site.
Contact form needs to have a validation system in place to prevent spam and unwanted emails.
* create a visually easy and appealing site.

## User Expectaions
* Pop out navigation bar on desktop and mobile devices to save on clutter.
* The navigation bar should direct you to specific places on the website whem clicked.
* Have a fully functional map available with added points to mark the locations being described.

## Design choices 
The main theme of this webiste was to create a simple yet modern design to a holiday destination website. 

## Font
I chose to use the font Merriweather as it applies a very simple yet seay to read style to the final website. The writing isnt too close together and allows for easy reading even on a small device.

## Icons
The only icon I thought was neccessary for the webiste to contain was a 'scroll to top' arrow, located int he bottom right hand corner of the screen.
This is presented to allow for the user to easily scroll to the top of the webiste, allowing for fast and easier access to the navigation bar. 
However, i have removed this from mobile viewing as it is easy to miss click that section of the screen, which could be frustrating for the user when 

## Colours
By choosing white text on a dark grey background allows the website to have a sleak design. 
This decreases eye strain and strengthens reading stamana in comparison to white text on a solid black background.
* The primary colour used for the backgrouns is #0c0c0c. A dark grey which allows for a good comparison and easy read against it.
* All text used #c5c5c5. This is a similar colour to the pop out nav bar allowing for constistancy to be continued throughout the website.

## Background and images
The background image I chose to use was a free image sourced from a royalty free website called unsplash.com. 
With the image being relatively large at the start of the website it invites people in. Making them question where the image was taken and to make them say 'I'd love to go to somewhere like that!'.
