# Holiday destinations

## Project goals
The goal of this project is to help users find the ideal snowboarding destination based on their needs. 
This project was aimed towards snowboarders who wished to find the best places to board all around the world.

## User goals
To use a website that helps them find out information about the best snow holiday for them.
Have an interactive map top allow users to pick a holiday destination.
Contact details provided to allow the user to ask any questions based on their holiday.
Interactive on both desktop and mobile devices

## Site owner goals
Gather information on where people tend to go when snowboarding.
Receive contact details through the use of contact form. 

## User requirements
* Have an interactive Google maps available to see certain holiday destinations.
* Navigate through the website by using an popout nav bar to save from clutter on the desktop and mobile site.
Contact form needs to have a validation system in place to prevent spam and unwanted emails.
* create a visually easy and appealing site.

## User Expectaions
* Pop out navigation bar on desktop and mobile devices to save on clutter.
* The navigation bar should direct you to specific places on the website whem clicked.
* Have a fully functional map available with added points to mark the locations being described.

## Design choices 
The main theme of this webiste was to create a simple yet modern design to a holiday destination website. 

## Font
I chose to use the font Merriweather as it applies a very simple yet seay to read style to the final website. The writing isnt too close together and allows for easy reading even on a small device.

## Icons
The only icon I thought was neccessary for the webiste to contain was a 'scroll to top' arrow, located int he bottom right hand corner of the screen.
This is presented to allow for the user to easily scroll to the top of the webiste, allowing for fast and easier access to the navigation bar. 
However, i have removed this from mobile viewing as it is easy to miss click that section of the screen, which could be frustrating for the user when 

## Colours
By choosing white text on a dark grey background allows the website to have a sleak design. 
This decreases eye strain and strengthens reading stamana in comparison to white text on a solid black background.
* The primary colour used for the backgrouns is #0c0c0c. A dark grey which allows for a good comparison and easy read against it.
* All text used #c5c5c5. This is a similar colour to the pop out nav bar allowing for constistancy to be continued throughout the website.

## Background and images
The background image I chose to use was a free image sourced from a royalty free website called unsplash.com. 
With the image being relatively large at the start of the website it invites people in. Making them question where the image was taken and to make them say 'I'd love to go to somewhere like that!'.

## Features
* Interactive Google Maps with location markers.
* Form validation at the end of the contact form to decrease spam.
* A pop out navigation bar.

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Tools and libraries
* Bootstrap
* Googlemaps
* Font awesome
* Github
* JQuery

## Testing
* Throughout the whole project there was rigorous testing down to make sure that the Google Maps section worked efficiently and didn’t have any glitches or faults when loading. This allowed me run the website 
with a max load time of 10-20 seconds load time depending on internet accessibility.
* Multiple testing was done on various internet browsers such as Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer and Chrome. There were no issues that I could find personally but it was noted that when testing on the Iphone SE, 
but found that the site requires horizontal scroll on screens as large as the Iphone X. 
* The only item that is off screen on a mobile device is the 'scroll to top' button. This was done on purpose. When holding a mobile phone in one hand (usually the right hand), it is very easy to accidently mis-touch 
the screen and tap on the bottom right corner with your palm. This doesn't affect the user experience as all the content is visible even without horizontal scroll and keeps a vertical screen clean.  

## Overall design
Personally I like the overall design of the site as it is minimalistic and clean to the eye of the user. However many websites use lighter colours to draw in their clients but with a more sleek design it appeals to 
those who want a relaxing/sleek holiday.

## Overall interactive maps


## Bugs
Originally there was an issue with the google maps where it wouldn’t load on the screen but this issue was resolved and fixed thanks to some editing in the stylesheet.css.
Another issue that was found was the ‘scroll to top’ button had a boarder around it but was outta place. I resolved this by taking out the boarder to give the website a more cleaner look. 
Other than the two problems above, there doesn’t seem to be anything which is causing a glitch to the website itself.
